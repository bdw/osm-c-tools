# osm-c-tools

NB: Since publishing this repository, the original author has
published his code on a
[gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/osm-c-tools/osmctools),
rendering this repository redundant. You are advised to look there.

The 'osm-c-tools' form a highly efficient, powerful set of programs,
developed by [Markus Weber](http://m.m.i24.cc/) and traditionally
published online. This repo is nothing but a repackaging of those
tools with a Makefile. It contains:

* [osmconvert](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) - a
  versatile conversion and geographical selection tool for various osm
  file formats..
  
* [osmfilter](http://wiki.openstreetma.org/wiki/Osmfilter) - a data
  selection tool for osm file formats.
  
* [osmupdate](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmupdate) - an update
  tool for osm file formats.
